        >You should check your vehicle's fluid levels at least once a month to
        ensure proper performance. Key fluids to monitor include engine oil,
        coolant, brake fluid, power steering fluid, and transmission fluid.
        Additionally, check fluids before long trips or if you notice any
        warning signs, such as dashboard alerts or changes in vehicle
        performance. Regular checks can help prevent costly repairs and keep
        your car running smoothly.</span
