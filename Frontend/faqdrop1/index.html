        >It's best to get an oil change every 5,000 to 7,500 miles to keep your
        engine running smoothly. Regular oil changes improve fuel efficiency,
        reduce wear, and extend the life of your engine. If you use synthetic
        oil or drive under special conditions, check your ownerâ€™s manual for
        specific intervals and recommendations tailored to your vehicle.</span
