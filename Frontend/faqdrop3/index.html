        >You should change your vehicle's oil every 5,000 to 7,500 miles,
        depending on the type of oil you use and your vehicle's specifications.
        If you use synthetic oil, the interval might extend up to 10,000 miles.
        Always check your owner’s manual for the manufacturer’s recommendation
        and adjust based on your driving habits or conditions, such as frequent
        short trips or towing.</span
