        >Tire rotations help ensure even wear across all four tires, improving
        their lifespan and maintaining optimal traction. Regular rotations also
        enhance fuel efficiency, promote better handling, and reduce the risk of
        blowouts. By rotating your tires every 5,000 to 7,500 miles, you can
        extend their life and ensure safer driving. Always refer to your
        vehicle's manual for recommended intervals.</span
