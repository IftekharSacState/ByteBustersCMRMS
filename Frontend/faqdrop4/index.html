        >You should replace your brake pads every 30,000 to 70,000 miles,
        depending on your driving habits and vehicle type. Signs that your brake
        pads need replacement include squeaking or grinding noises, reduced
        braking performance, or a dashboard brake warning light. For the best
        safety and performance, have your brake pads inspected regularly,
        especially if you frequently drive in stop-and-go traffic or tow heavy
        loads. Always consult your vehicleâ€™s manual for specific
        recommendations.</span
