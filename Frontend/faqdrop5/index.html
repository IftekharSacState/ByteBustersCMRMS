        >Car batteries typically last 3 to 5 years, but factors like climate,
        driving habits, and vehicle type can affect this lifespan. It's a good
        idea to have your battery tested annually after three years of use,
        especially if you notice slow engine starts, dim headlights, or
        electrical issues. Replacing your battery before it fails completely can
        help avoid unexpected breakdowns. Always check your vehicleâ€™s manual for
        specific guidelines.</span
